"""
Baiting Logic Priorities Validation Test Suite.

This test suite validates the implementation of critical baiting logic priorities
to ensure complete coverage of JavaScript behavior.

Priority Coverage:
HIGH PRIORITY:
✅ Self-buffing move exceptions (critical for accuracy)
✅ wouldShield method validation (affects all baiting decisions)  
✅ DPE ratio analysis validation (core baiting logic)

MEDIUM PRIORITY:
❌ Edge case handling (low health, close DPE moves) - NEEDS ENHANCEMENT
❌ Multiple shield scenarios - NEEDS IMPLEMENTATION
❌ Energy capping and state transitions - NEEDS IMPLEMENTATION
