### **2. MISSING SUPPORTING CLASSES**
The Python implementation lacks the `DecisionOption` class:

```python
@dataclass
class DecisionOption:
    name: str
    weight: int
```

### **3. INCOMPLETE SHIELD DECISION LOGIC**
The `would_shield` method exists but is **missing critical components**:
- **Buff/Debuff Handling**: Temporary stat changes during shield calculations
- **Cycle Damage Calculations**: Complex multi-turn damage projections
- **Attack Debuffing Move Detection**: Special shielding for moves like Superpower

### **4. MISSING POKEMON PROPERTIES**
The JavaScript version relies on Pokemon properties that may not exist in Python:
- `poke.activeChargedMoves` (vs current `charged_move_1/2`)
- `poke.fastestChargedMove` 
- `poke.bestChargedMove`
- `poke.farmEnergy` flag
- `poke.baitShields` setting
- `poke.optimizeMoveTiming` flag
- `poke.priority` for move ordering
- `poke.turnsToKO` calculation
- `opponent.turnsToKO` calculation

### **5. MISSING MOVE PROPERTIES**
Moves need additional properties:
- `move.selfDebuffing` flag
- `move.selfBuffing` flag  
- `move.selfAttackDebuffing` flag
- `move.buffApplyChance` probability
- `move.buffTarget` ("self" or "opponent")
- `move.buffs` array for stat changes
- `move.dpe` (damage per energy) calculation

### **6. MISSING BATTLE CONTEXT**
The battle system needs:
- `battle.getMode()` method ("simulate" vs "emulate")
- `battle.getQueuedActions()` for move timing optimization
- `battle.logDecision()` for debugging output
- Turn-based cooldown system integration

### **7. TRAINING AI INTEGRATION**
The JavaScript has a separate `TrainingAI` class with advanced features:
- **Switch Decision Logic**: When to switch Pokemon
- **Energy Guessing**: Estimating opponent energy levels  
- **Strategy Processing**: Different AI difficulty levels
- **Reaction Time Simulation**: Human-like delays

### **8. TIMELINE SYSTEM**
Missing timeline management:
- `TimelineEvent` class for battle history
- Action queuing and processing
- Turn-based execution order

## Move Timing Optimization - Detailed Implementation Plan

### Overview
Move Timing Optimization is a sophisticated system that prevents Pokemon from giving opponents "free turns" by timing charged moves optimally. The system analyzes fast move cooldowns and determines the best moments to throw charged moves to minimize opponent advantage.

### Core Concept
- **Free Turns**: When a Pokemon throws a charged move while the opponent is in the middle of a fast move, the opponent gets to complete their fast move "for free"
- **Target Cooldown**: The optimal opponent cooldown window (500ms or less) to throw charged moves
- **Timing Windows**: Calculated moments when throwing a charged move won't give the opponent extra fast moves

### Step 2A: Target Cooldown Calculation Logic

#### 2A.1: Basic Target Cooldown Rules
```python
def calculate_target_cooldown(self, poke: Pokemon, opponent: Pokemon) -> int:
    """Calculate the target cooldown for optimal move timing."""
    target_cooldown = 500  # Default: throw when opponent has 500ms or less cooldown
    
    # Rule 1: Pokemon with 4+ turn moves (2000ms+) use 1000ms target
    if poke.fast_move.cooldown >= 2000:
        target_cooldown = 1000
    
    # Rule 2: 3-turn vs 5-turn matchup (1500ms vs 2500ms)
    if poke.fast_move.cooldown >= 1500 and opponent.fast_move.cooldown == 2500:
        target_cooldown = 1000
    
    # Rule 3: 2-turn vs 4-turn matchup (1000ms vs 2000ms)  
    if poke.fast_move.cooldown == 1000 and opponent.fast_move.cooldown == 2000:
        target_cooldown = 1000
    
    return target_cooldown
```

#### 2A.2: Optimization Disabling Rules
```python
def should_disable_timing_optimization(self, poke: Pokemon, opponent: Pokemon) -> bool:
    """Check if timing optimization should be disabled."""
    
    # Disable for same duration moves (no advantage possible)
    if poke.fast_move.cooldown == opponent.fast_move.cooldown:
        return True
    
    # Disable for evenly divisible longer moves (e.g., 4-turn vs 2-turn, 3-turn vs 1-turn)
    if (poke.fast_move.cooldown % opponent.fast_move.cooldown == 0 and 
        poke.fast_move.cooldown > opponent.fast_move.cooldown):
        return True
    
    return False
```

### Step 2B: Timing Optimization Safety Checks

#### 2B.1: Survival Checks
```python
def check_survival_conditions(self, battle, poke: Pokemon, opponent: Pokemon) -> bool:
    """Verify Pokemon can safely optimize timing without fainting."""
    
    # Don't optimize if about to faint from opponent's fast move
    if poke.current_hp <= opponent.fast_move.damage:
        return False
    
    # Don't optimize if opponent can KO with fast moves during our fast move
    fast_moves_in_window = math.floor((poke.fast_move.cooldown + 500) / opponent.fast_move.cooldown)
    if poke.current_hp <= opponent.fast_move.damage * fast_moves_in_window:
        return False
    
    return True
```

#### 2B.2: Energy Management
```python
def check_energy_conditions(self, battle, poke: Pokemon) -> bool:
    """Ensure energy won't overflow with timing optimization."""
    
    # Count queued fast moves
    queued_fast_moves = 0
    queued_actions = battle.get_queued_actions()
    
    for action in queued_actions:
        if action.actor == poke.index and action.type == "fast":
            queued_fast_moves += 1
    
    # Add 1 for the fast move we're considering
    queued_fast_moves += 1
    
    # Don't optimize if we'll exceed 100 energy
    future_energy = poke.energy + (poke.fast_move.energy_gain * queued_fast_moves)
    if future_energy > 100:
        return False
    
    return True
```

#### 2B.3: Strategic Timing Checks
```python
def check_strategic_conditions(self, battle, poke: Pokemon, opponent: Pokemon, turns_to_live: int) -> bool:
    """Check strategic conditions for timing optimization."""
    
    # Calculate planned turns (fast move + charged moves we can throw)
    planned_turns = poke.fast_move.turns + math.floor(poke.energy / poke.active_charged_moves[0].energy_cost)
    
    # Add extra turn if we lose CMP (lower attack stat)
    if poke.stats.atk < opponent.stats.atk:
        planned_turns += 1
    
    # Don't optimize if we have fewer turns to live than planned actions
    if planned_turns > turns_to_live:
        return False
    
    # Don't optimize if we can KO opponent with a charged move (no shields)
    if opponent.shields == 0:
        for move in poke.active_charged_moves:
            move_damage = DamageCalculator.calculate_damage(poke, opponent, move)
            if poke.energy >= move.energy_cost and move_damage >= opponent.current_hp:
                return False
    
    # Don't optimize if opponent can KO us with their charged move
    for move in opponent.active_charged_moves:
        fast_moves_needed = math.ceil((move.energy_cost - opponent.energy) / opponent.fast_move.energy_gain)
        fast_moves_in_window = math.floor(poke.fast_move.cooldown / opponent.fast_move.cooldown)
        turns_from_move = (fast_moves_needed * opponent.fast_move.turns) + 1
        
        move_damage = DamageCalculator.calculate_damage(opponent, poke, move)
        total_damage = move_damage + (opponent.fast_move.damage * fast_moves_in_window)
        
        # Account for shields
        if poke.shields > 0:
            total_damage = 1 + (opponent.fast_move.damage * fast_moves_in_window)
        
        if turns_from_move <= poke.fast_move.turns and total_damage >= poke.current_hp:
            return False
    
    return True
```

### Step 2C: Battle Context Integration

#### 2C.1: Battle Class Extensions
```python
class Battle:
    def __init__(self):
        self.queued_actions = []  # List of TimelineAction objects
        self.debug_mode = False
    
    def get_queued_actions(self) -> List[TimelineAction]:
        """Return list of actions queued by all Pokemon."""
        return self.queued_actions
    
    def log_decision(self, pokemon: Pokemon, message: str) -> None:
        """Log AI decision for debugging."""
        if not self.debug_mode:
            return
        
        print(f"Turn {self.current_turn}: {pokemon.species_id} {message}")
```

#### 2C.2: Main Timing Optimization Logic
```python
def optimize_move_timing(self, battle, poke: Pokemon, opponent: Pokemon, turns_to_live: int) -> bool:
    """
    Main move timing optimization logic.
    
    Returns:
        True if should wait (optimize timing), False if should proceed with charged move
    """
    
    # Check if optimization is enabled
    if not getattr(poke, 'optimize_move_timing', False):
        return False
    
    # Calculate target cooldown
    target_cooldown = self.calculate_target_cooldown(poke, opponent)
    
    # Check if optimization should be disabled
    if self.should_disable_timing_optimization(poke, opponent):
        target_cooldown = 0
    
    # Only optimize if opponent is at target cooldown or higher, and target > 0
    if not ((opponent.cooldown == 0 or opponent.cooldown > target_cooldown) and target_cooldown > 0):
        return False
    
    # Run all safety and strategic checks
    if not self.check_survival_conditions(battle, poke, opponent):
        return False

    # All checks passed - optimize timing
    battle.log_decision(poke, " is optimizing move timing")
    return True  # Return early, don't throw charged move this turn
```

### Integration Points

#### Pokemon Class Extensions Needed:
- `optimize_move_timing: bool` - Flag to enable/disable timing optimization
- `active_charged_moves: List[Move]` - List of available charged moves
- `cooldown: int` - Current fast move cooldown (0 = ready to act)

#### Move Class Extensions Needed:
- `cooldown: int` - Move duration in milliseconds
- `turns: int` - Move duration in turns (cooldown / 500)
- `damage: int` - Cached damage calculation
- `energy_cost: int` - Energy required to use move
- `energy_gain: int` - Energy gained from using move (fast moves only)

#### Battle Class Extensions Needed:
- `get_queued_actions() -> List[TimelineAction]` - Return queued actions
- `log_decision(pokemon, message)` - Debug logging
- `current_turn: int` - Current battle turn number
- `debug_mode: bool` - Enable/disable debug output

### Testing Strategy

#### Unit Tests Needed:
1. **Target Cooldown Calculation**: Test all cooldown rules and edge cases
2. **Optimization Disabling**: Verify same/divisible move duration handling  
3. **Survival Checks**: Test faint prevention logic
4. **Energy Management**: Test overflow prevention
5. **Strategic Conditions**: Test turns-to-live and KO prevention logic
6. **Integration**: Test with Battle class methods

#### Integration Tests:
1. **Real Battle Scenarios**: Test optimization in actual battle simulations
2. **Performance Impact**: Ensure optimization doesn't slow down battles significantly
3. **JavaScript Parity**: Compare decisions with JavaScript implementation

### Performance Considerations
- Cache damage calculations where possible
- Limit queued action list size to prevent memory issues
- Consider disabling optimization in fast simulation modes
- Profile timing optimization impact on battle speed

## Lethal Move Detection - Detailed Implementation Plan

### Overview
Lethal Move Detection is a critical AI component that identifies when a Pokemon can knock out (KO) the opponent with available moves. This system ensures the AI prioritizes finishing moves when victory is achievable, preventing unnecessary prolonged battles or missed opportunities.

### Core Concept
- **Lethal Move**: Any move that can reduce opponent's HP to 0 or below
- **Shield Consideration**: Account for opponent shields reducing charged move damage to 1
- **Energy Validation**: Ensure Pokemon has sufficient energy to use the lethal move
- **Priority Ordering**: When multiple lethal moves exist, choose the most efficient one

### Testing Strategy

#### Unit Tests:
1. **Basic Lethal Detection**: Test single move KO scenarios
2. **Shield Interaction**: Test lethal detection with/without shields
3. **Energy Validation**: Test insufficient energy scenarios
4. **Multi-Move Combinations**: Test charged + fast move sequences
5. **Buff Consideration**: Test lethal detection with stat changes
6. **Special Cases**: Test 1 HP scenarios and edge cases

#### Integration Tests:
1. **DP Algorithm Integration**: Test lethal detection within DP states
2. **Decision Weight Boosting**: Verify lethal moves get priority
3. **Victory State Handling**: Test immediate victory scenarios
4. **Performance Impact**: Ensure lethal detection doesn't slow battles

#### Test Cases:
```python
def test_basic_lethal_detection():

### Performance Considerations
- Cache lethal damage calculations for repeated checks
- Limit multi-move combination depth to prevent exponential complexity
- Use early returns when lethal move is found
- Consider disabling complex lethal detection in fast simulation modes

## Shield Baiting Logic - Detailed Implementation Plan

### Overview
Shield Baiting Logic is a sophisticated AI strategy that manipulates opponent shield usage by strategically choosing which charged moves to throw. The system analyzes move efficiency (DPE - Damage Per Energy) and predicts opponent shielding behavior to maximize damage output while conserving shields.

### Core Concept
- **Shield Baiting**: Using lower-energy, less efficient moves to force opponents to waste shields
- **DPE (Damage Per Energy)**: The efficiency metric `damage / energy_cost` used to compare moves
- **Bait Move**: A lower-energy move used to "bait" a shield before throwing a more powerful move
- **DPE Ratio**: Comparison between moves to determine if baiting is worthwhile (threshold: 1.5x)

        self.bait_shields = False  # Enable/disable baiting behavior
        self.active_charged_moves = []  # Sorted list of available charged moves
    
    # Add all DPE calculation methods
    def calculate_move_dpe(self, move, opponent): ...
    def calculate_buff_dpe_multiplier(self, move): ...
```

#### Move Class Extensions Needed:

### Testing Strategy

#### Unit Tests:
1. **DPE Calculation**: Test damage per energy calculations with various moves and buffs
2. **Basic Baiting Logic**: Test shield baiting decision making
3. **DPE Ratio Analysis**: Test 1.5x threshold and move selection
4. **Move Reordering**: Test damage-based vs efficiency-based sorting
5. **Advanced Conditions**: Test build-up logic, health checks, energy validation
6. **Self-Debuffing Avoidance**: Test avoidance of debuffing moves during baiting

#### Integration Tests:
1. **DP Algorithm Integration**: Test baiting within DP state evaluation
2. **Decision Weight Calculation**: Test baiting weight in decision options
3. **Real Battle Scenarios**: Test baiting in actual battle simulations
4. **JavaScript Parity**: Compare baiting decisions with JavaScript implementation

#### Test Cases:
```python
def test_basic_shield_baiting():
    """Test basic shield baiting with DPE difference."""
    # Setup: Pokemon with 35 energy move (DPE 2.0) and 50 energy move (DPE 3.5)
    # Expected: Should bait with 35 energy move when opponent has shields
    
def test_dpe_ratio_threshold():
    """Test 1.5x DPE ratio threshold for baiting."""
    # Setup: Moves with DPE ratio of 1.4 (below threshold)
    # Expected: Should not bait due to insufficient DPE advantage

    """Test avoidance of self-debuffing moves during baiting."""
    # Setup: Self-debuffing move vs normal move, opponent has shields
    # Expected: Should prefer non-debuffing move for baiting

### Performance Considerations
- Cache DPE calculations for repeated move evaluations
- Limit baiting analysis depth to prevent performance impact
- Use early returns when baiting conditions aren't met
- Consider disabling complex baiting logic in fast simulation modes

## Self-Debuffing Move Handling - Detailed Implementation Plan

### Overview
Self-Debuffing Move Handling is a sophisticated AI system that manages moves with negative stat effects on the user (like Superpower, Close Combat, Overheat). The system implements strategic timing to minimize the negative impact of debuffs while maximizing damage output through energy stacking and optimal usage patterns.

### Core Concept
- **Self-Debuffing Moves**: Moves that reduce the user's attack or defense stats after use
- **Energy Stacking**: Building energy to use multiple debuffing moves in succession to minimize debuff duration
- **Deferral Logic**: Delaying debuffing moves when opponent has lethal moves ready
- **Baiting Override**: Preferring non-debuffing moves for shield baiting when available

### Required Extensions

#### Pokemon Class Extensions
```python
class Pokemon:
    def __init__(self):
        # ... existing initialization
        self.active_form_id = None  # For form-specific logic (Aegislash)
        self.best_charged_move = None  # Cached best move reference
```

#### Move Class Extensions
```python
class Move:

        # ... existing initialization
        self.self_debuffing = False  # Move debuffs user's stats
        self.self_attack_debuffing = False  # Move debuffs user's attack
        self.self_defense_debuffing = False  # Move debuffs user's defense
        self.self_buffing = False  # Move buffs user's stats
```

### Testing Strategy

#### Unit Tests
1. **Deferral Logic**: Test deferral when opponent has lethal moves
2. **Energy Stacking**: Test target energy calculation and stacking decisions
3. **Baiting Override**: Test preference for non-debuffing moves during baiting
4. **Aegislash Logic**: Test form-specific energy building
5. **Survivability Checks**: Test various survivability scenarios

#### Integration Tests
1. **DP Algorithm Integration**: Test self-debuffing logic within DP states
2. **Real Battle Scenarios**: Test with actual self-debuffing moves (Superpower, Close Combat)
3. **JavaScript Parity**: Compare decisions with JavaScript implementation
4. **Performance Impact**: Ensure logic doesn't slow down battles

#### Test Cases
```python
def test_superpower_deferral():
    """Test deferring Superpower when opponent has lethal Hydro Cannon ready."""
    # Setup: Opponent has Hydro Cannon ready, Pokemon has Superpower
    # Expected: Should defer Superpower and use fast move
    
def test_energy_stacking_calculation():
    """Test energy stacking for 50-energy move (should target 100 energy)."""
    # Setup: Pokemon with 50-energy self-debuffing move, current energy 60
    # Expected: Should build to 100 energy for 2-move stack
    
def test_aegislash_energy_building():
    """Test Aegislash Shield form energy building."""
    # Setup: Aegislash Shield with 80 energy, fast move gains 3 energy
    # Expected: Should build to ~98 energy before using charged move
```

### Performance Considerations
- Cache form change calculations for Aegislash
- Limit energy stacking analysis to prevent infinite loops
- Use early returns when conditions aren't met
- Consider disabling complex logic in fast simulation modes

## Energy Stacking - Detailed Implementation Plan

### Overview
Energy Stacking is a strategic optimization for self-debuffing moves that minimizes the time a Pokemon spends in a debuffed state. Instead of using a self-debuffing move as soon as it's available, the AI builds energy to use the move multiple times in quick succession, reducing the overall impact of the debuff.

### Core Concept
- **Energy Stacking**: Building energy to use a self-debuffing move multiple times consecutively
- **Target Energy**: The optimal energy level calculated as `floor(100 / move.energy) * move.energy`
- **Debuff Minimization**: By stacking moves, the Pokemon spends fewer turns in a debuffed state
- **Strategic Timing**: Only stack when it's safe and won't result in missing a KO opportunity

### JavaScript Reference
Lines 918-935 in ActionLogic.js:
```javascript
// If move is self debuffing and doesn't KO, try to stack as much as you can
if (finalState.moves[0].selfDebuffing) {
    let targetEnergy = Math.floor(100 / finalState.moves[0].energy) * finalState.moves[0].energy;
    
    if (poke.energy < targetEnergy) {
        var moveDamage = DamageCalculator.damage(poke, opponent, finalState.moves[0]);
        if ((opponent.hp > moveDamage || opponent.shields != 0) && 
            (poke.hp > opponent.fastMove.damage * 2 || 
             opponent.fastMove.cooldown - poke.fastMove.cooldown > 500)){
            battle.logDecision(poke, " doesn't use " + finalState.moves[0].name + 
                " because it wants to minimize time debuffed and it can stack the move " + 
                Math.floor(100 / finalState.moves[0].energy) + " times");
            return;
        }
    } else if(poke.baitShields && opponent.shields > 0 && 
              poke.activeChargedMoves[0].energy - finalState.moves[0].energy <= 10 && 
              ! poke.activeChargedMoves[0].selfDebuffing){
        // Use the lower energy move if it's a boosting move or if opponent would shield
        if(poke.activeChargedMoves[0].selfBuffing || 
           ActionLogic.wouldShield(battle, poke, opponent, finalState.moves[0]).value){
            finalState.moves[0] = poke.activeChargedMoves[0];
        }

### Step 1T: Integrate Energy Stacking with Shield Baiting Override ✅ COMPLETED

**Status**: ✅ **COMPLETE** (October 5, 2025)  
**JavaScript Reference**: ActionLogic.js lines 929-934  
**Test Coverage**: 17 tests (100% passing)  
**Implementation**: `python/pvpoke/battle/ai.py` lines 2735-2900

This step completes the energy stacking system by integrating shield baiting override logic. When at or above target stacking energy, the AI can override self-debuffing moves with better alternatives for baiting shields.

**Key Features**:
- Finds alternative moves with close energy costs (within 10)
- Prioritizes self-buffing moves during shield baiting
- Uses opponent shield prediction to make optimal decisions
- Only applies when at or above target stacking energy

**Methods Implemented**:
1. `check_baiting_override_for_stacking()` - Find suitable alternative moves
2. `should_use_buffing_move_instead()` - Prioritize self-buffing alternatives
3. `should_swap_based_on_shield_prediction()` - Swap based on opponent behavior
4. `apply_baiting_override_for_stacking()` - Main integration point

**Test Results**:
- ✅ 5 tests for close energy cost comparison
- ✅ 4 tests for self-buffing move priority
- ✅ 3 tests for opponent shield prediction
- ✅ 5 tests for integrated baiting override logic
- ✅ All 17 tests passing with zero linter errors

**Integration**: Works seamlessly with Step 1S (Core Energy Stacking Logic) and Step 1Q (Shield Baiting Override). Called in `decide_action()` after energy stacking check to determine final move selection.

### Integration with Main Decision Logic

#### Integration Point in decide_action Method
```python
def decide_action(self, poke: Pokemon, opponent: Pokemon) -> str:
    """Main decision method with energy stacking logic."""
    
    # ... existing DP algorithm logic ...
    
    # After DP algorithm selects best move, apply energy stacking logic
    if hasattr(finalState, 'moves') and finalState.moves:
        selected_move = finalState.moves[0]
        
        # Step 1S: Check if should build energy for stacking
        if self.should_stack_energy_for_debuffing_move(poke, opponent, selected_move):
            max_uses = math.floor(100 / selected_move.energy_cost)
            self.battle.log_decision(
                poke, 
                f" doesn't use {selected_move.name} because it wants to minimize time debuffed "
                f"and it can stack the move {max_uses} times"
            )
            return "fast"  # Build energy with fast move

        if selected_move != finalState.moves[0]:
            self.battle.log_decision(
                poke,
                f" uses {selected_move.name} instead to avoid self-debuffing while baiting"
            )
    
    # ... continue with move execution logic ...
```

### Testing Strategy

#### Unit Tests
1. **Target Energy Calculation**: Test calculation for various energy costs
2. **KO Validation**: Test that stacking doesn't miss KO opportunities
3. **Survivability Checks**: Test various HP and cooldown scenarios
4. **Baiting Override**: Test move swapping when baiting shields
5. **Self-Buffing Priority**: Test preference for buffing moves

#### Integration Tests
1. **Full Stacking Scenario**: Test complete energy stacking flow
2. **Baiting Integration**: Test stacking with shield baiting
3. **Real Battle Scenarios**: Test with actual self-debuffing moves (Superpower, Close Combat)
4. **JavaScript Parity**: Compare decisions with JavaScript implementation

#### Test Cases
```python
def test_stacking_target_energy_calculation():
    """Test target energy calculation for various move costs."""
    # 35 energy: floor(100/35) * 35 = 70
    # 40 energy: floor(100/40) * 40 = 80
    # 45 energy: floor(100/45) * 45 = 90
    # 50 energy: floor(100/50) * 50 = 100
    # 55 energy: floor(100/55) * 55 = 55
    
def test_stacking_prevents_ko_miss():
    """Test that stacking doesn't miss KO opportunities."""
    # Setup: Opponent at 50 HP, Superpower does 60 damage, no shields
    # Expected: Should NOT stack, use move immediately for KO
    
def test_stacking_survivability_hp_check():
    """Test survivability check based on HP."""
    # Setup: Pokemon at 30 HP, opponent fast move does 10 damage
    # Expected: Should stack (HP > damage * 2)
    
def test_stacking_survivability_cooldown_check():
    """Test survivability check based on cooldown advantage."""
    # Setup: Pokemon at 15 HP, opponent fast move does 10 damage, 
    #        but cooldown advantage > 500ms
    # Expected: Should stack (timing advantage compensates for low HP)
    
def test_baiting_override_with_buffing_move():
    """Test baiting override prefers self-buffing alternative."""
    # Setup: At target energy, has self-buffing 35-energy move and 
    #        self-debuffing 40-energy move, opponent has shields
    # Expected: Should use self-buffing move for baiting
    
def test_baiting_override_shield_prediction():
    """Test baiting override based on opponent shield prediction."""
    # Setup: At target energy, opponent would shield debuffing move,
    #        has non-debuffing alternative within 10 energy
    # Expected: Should swap to non-debuffing alternative
```

### Performance Considerations
- Cache target energy calculations for repeated checks
- Use early returns when conditions aren't met
- Limit stacking analysis to self-debuffing moves only
- Consider disabling complex stacking logic in fast simulation modes

### Edge Cases to Handle
1. **Single-Use Moves**: Moves with energy cost > 50 (can only use once)
2. **Low HP Scenarios**: When Pokemon might faint before reaching target energy
3. **Opponent Lethal Moves**: When opponent can KO during energy building
4. **Multiple Debuffing Moves**: When Pokemon has multiple self-debuffing options
5. **Shield Baiting Priority**: When baiting is more important than stacking
